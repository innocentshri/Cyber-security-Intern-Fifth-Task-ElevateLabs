# Task 5 - Malware Types & Behavior Analysis 

## Objective
The objective of this task is to understand different types of malware, their behavior, how they spread, and how they are detected using online analysis platforms like VirusTotal.

---

## Tools Used 
- VirusTotal
- Online malware analysis resources

---

## What is Malware?
Malware is any software that is intentionally designed to cause damage, Steal data, disrupt system, or gain unauthorized access to computers and networks.

---
 ## Types of Malware Studied 

 ### 1. Virus
 - Attaches itself to legitimate files
 - Spreads when infected files are executed
 - Can corrupt or delete data

### 2. Worm
- Self-replicating
- Spreads automatically across networks
- Does not require user interaction

### 3. Trojan 
- Disguised as legitimate software
- Creates backdoors for attackers
- Does not self-replicate

### 4. Ransomware
- Encrypts user data
- Demands payment for decryption
- One of the most dangerous malware types

## Malware Lifecycle 
1. Creation
2. Distribution
3. Execution
4. Persistence
5. Data theft or damage
6. Spread to other systems

---

## How Malware spreads 
- Email attachments
- Malicious websites
- Fake software downloads
- USB drivers
- Network vulnerabilities

---

##Malware Detection Using VirusTotal
VirusTotal scans files or hases using multiple antivirus engines. 
It provdes:
- Detection ratio
- Malware Family name
- Behavior indicators
- Threat category

---

## Example Analysis Method (Without Uploading Real Malware)
Instead of uploading live malware, known malware hashes are searched on VirusTotal to:
- Observed detection reports
- Identify malware type
- Understand behavior patterns
- Study reputation and threat levels

This method is safe and ethical.

---

## Behavior Indicators Observed
Common malware behavior includes:
- Creating unknown processes
- Modifying system files
- Making external network connections
- Running in background silently

---

## Malware Prevention Methods
- Use updated antivirus software
- Keep OS and apps updated
- Avoid suspicious downloads
- Do not open unknown email attachments
- Enable firewall
- Use strong passwords and MFA
- Regular system backups

---

## Summary
This task helped in understanding:
- Different malware types
- How malware behaves
- How malware spreads
- How detection systems work
- How to protect systems from malware

---

## Final Outcome 
Gained basic knowledge of malware awareness and detection techniques.
