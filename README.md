# Task 5 – Malware Types & Behavior Analysis

## Objective
The objective of this task is to understand different types of malware, their behavior, how they spread, and how they are detected using online analysis platforms like VirusTotal.

---

## Tools Used
- VirusTotal (Primary)
- Online malware analysis resources

---

## What is Malware?
Malware is any software that is intentionally designed to cause damage, steal data, disrupt systems, or gain unauthorized access to computers and networks.

---

## Types of Malware Studied

### 1. Virus
- Attaches itself to legitimate files
- Spreads when infected files are executed
- Can corrupt or delete data

### 2. Worm
- Self-replicating
- Spreads automatically across networks
- Does not require user interaction

### 3. Trojan
- Disguised as legitimate software
- Creates backdoors for attackers
- Does not self-replicate

### 4. Ransomware
- Encrypts user data
- Demands payment for decryption
- One of the most dangerous malware types

---

## Malware Lifecycle
1. Creation  
2. Distribution  
3. Execution  
4. Persistence  
5. Data theft or damage  
6. Spread to other systems  

---

## How Malware Spreads
- Email attachments
- Malicious websites
- Fake software downloads
- USB drives
- Network vulnerabilities

---

## Malware Detection Using VirusTotal
VirusTotal scans files or hashes using multiple antivirus engines.  
It provides:
- Detection ratio
- Malware family name
- Behavior indicators
- Threat category

---

## Example Analysis Method (Without Uploading Real Malware)
Instead of uploading live malware, known malware hashes are searched on VirusTotal to:
- Observe detection reports
- Identify malware type
- Understand behavior patterns
- Study reputation and threat levels

This method is safe and ethical.

---

## Behavior Indicators Observed
Common malware behavior includes:
- Creating unknown processes
- Modifying system files
- Making external network connections
- Running in background silently

---

## Malware Prevention Methods
- Use updated antivirus software
- Keep OS and apps updated
- Avoid suspicious downloads
- Do not open unknown email attachments
- Enable firewall
- Use strong passwords and MFA
- Regular system backups

---

## Summary
This task helped in understanding:
- Different malware types
- How malware behaves
- How malware spreads
- How detection systems work
- How to protect systems from malware

---

## Final Outcome
Gained basic knowledge of malware awareness and detection techniques.
